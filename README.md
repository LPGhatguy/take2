# take(5)
*"Take Five"* is:
* A jazz standard
* A chocolate bar
* An expression for *"take a break"*
* An operation you can use when building a parser

It's also an *anti-magic* parser combinator framework for Rust.

Work in progress, here be dragons, etc.

## Goals
* *Lexeme-oriented* parsing
* Trait-based combinators where possible, macros only where necessary
* Anything macro-based should have obvious non-macro alternatives
